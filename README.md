# Introduction to GitHub Actions

This repository contains the content used for a introductionary workshop about
GitHub Actions. The intendent workshop length is around 210 minutes. The idea
of the workshop is that the instructor goes through the slides giving a short
overview of relevant features and the workshop participants work on tasks using
these features afterwards. Be aware that GitHub Actions are actively developed
by GitHub and this workshop may be out of date.

The `slides.md` (also `slides.pdf`) file in this repository contains the
lecturer's slides. The `exercises.md` file (also `exercises.pdf`) contain
exercises.

## Requirements

In order to follow the steps of this workshop you need

-   A GitHub account
-   Enough credits/minutes for workflows to run if you make a **private**
repository. The amount of workflow minutes needed for this workshop is low.
-   A copy or fork of this repository.

    - If you create a fork, you may want to copy all branches instead
    of `main` only. There is a branch called `solution` that contains the final
    state of the repository.

    - If you forked the repository, ensure that Actions are enabled

      GitHub might disable the Actions on forks for improved security.

You can then work on your fork/copy via a local clone on you pc or by using a
GitHub Codespace. The repository contains a devcontainer configuration such
that you can start a codespace directly from this repository.

## Learning Goals

-   You are able to add workflows to a Git repository.
-   You are able to inspect the results of a workflow.
-   You know some common, useful actions provided by GitHub.
-   You know where to look for more information about GitHub workflows.

## Checkpoints

-   `main` branch: Contains the starting point
-   `solution` branch: Contains the repository in its intended final state
