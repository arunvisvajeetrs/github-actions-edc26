- What is your name?
- Where are you located?
- If you could choose to transform into an animal (and back), what animal
  would you choose?

# Goals & Outcomes

- Read and write GitHub workflows
- Have understanding workflow files
- Use pre-defined Actions
- Use matrix builds and multi‑OS testing
- Have some fundamental knowledge about security
- Create downloadable artifacts and use Docker containers

---

# Schedule

- 10:00: Start of workshop
- Breaks as we need them
- 13:30: End of workshop

---

# Logistics & Prerequisites

- GitHub account, basic git (clone/commit/push)
- Laptop with browser, VS Code (or editor)
- Codespaces recommended
- Starter repo with sample code and tests

---

# What is "GitHub Actions"?

> GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
> platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment
> pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to
> your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

From:
[docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions)

---

# Exercise 0: Initial Setup

- Create a copy or fork of the workshop repository

[https://github.com/ajaust/introduction-to-github-actions-edc26](https://github.com/ajaust/introduction-to-github-actions-edc26)

If you create a fork, copy all branches. There is a `solution` branch.

---

# Exercise 1: Create Your First Workflow

- Create the `first_workflow.yml` file in repo
- Commit and push
- Open Actions tab and inspect the run

---

# Anatomy of a workflow file

```yaml
name: My first GitHub workflow
run-name: First workflow # Optional, modifies appearance on GitHub

# Events triggering the workflow
on: [push]

# Group of jobs to run as part of the workflow
jobs:
  # A job
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello world"
```

---

# Workflow triggers

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Common events (some with activity types)
  - `push`
  - `pull_request`
  - `schedule`: Scheduled using `cron` syntax
  - `workflow_dispatch`: Trigger workflow manually from your repository
- Can combined with branches (2 ways to specify list of branches)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main
    workflow_dispatch:
  ```

# Executing jobs (1/2)
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- A workflow can have several jobs
- Jobs have a `job_id` (`job_one`, `job_two`)
- Jobs run on a runner, we will stick to GitHub-hosted runners
  - `ubuntu-latest` (Linux)
  - `macos-latest`
  - `windows-latest`
- Jobs can have names

runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```yaml
[...]
jobs:
  job_one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Steps can have a name"
        run: echo "Hello world"
  job_two:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    name: "Job with a name"
    steps:
      - name: "Step with multi-line commands"
        run: |
        echo "Hello from"
        echo "job_two"
```
:::
::::::::::::::

---

# Executing jobs (2/2)
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- A job can contain many steps
- Jobs can depend on each other via `needs: <job_id>`
- Jobs can have timeouts

runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)

```yaml
[...]
jobs:
  multistep_job:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Steps can have a name"
        run: echo "Hello world"
      - name: "So sleepy... zzzZZZzz"
        run: sleep 30 # sleeps for 30 seconds
  dependent_job:
    needs: multistep_job
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job on windows runner"
```

# Exercise 2: Multi-job workflows and failing jobs

# Variables, expressions and contexts

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}

- Evaluate an expression using `${{ EXPRESSION }}`
- Many contexts exists `github`, `env`, `job`, `secrets`...
- Can be combined with conditionals `if: CONDITION`
  - Can be used on different levels: `job`-level, `step`-level

Contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts)

:::
::: {.column width="65%"}

```yaml
env:
  MyVariable: "Hello world"
[...]
jobs:
  [...]
  job_id:
    env:
      JobVariable: "This is a job variable"
    steps:
    - run: echo "${{ env.MyVariable }}"
    - run: echo "${MyVariable}"
    - name: Evaluate "github.action"
      run: echo "${{ github.action }}"
    - name: "Print matrix version"
      if: ${{ matrix.python-version == '3.14' }}
      run: echo "${{ matrix.python-version }}"
```

# Debugging GitHub workflows

- Quite simple to add mistakes, quite hard to catch early
- Hard to run actions locally, e.g, via [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- Good solution: [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) is a "Static
  checker for GitHub Actions workflow files"
  - Is preinstalled on our Codespace
  - `https://github.com/nektos/act`
- Hard to run actions locally, e.g, via [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)

# Strategies (matrix jobs)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- On can use premade Actions
- Actions in `actions/` are maintained by GitHub
- [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) checks
  out the repository
- [`actions/setup-python`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python)
  configures a Python version
  - Similar actions exist for other environments, e.g., Node/Javascript etc.

workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/find-and-customize-actions)

```yaml

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: [ "3.12", "3.13" ]
        os: [ "macos-latest", "ubuntu-latest" ]
```

# Building on top of other Actions

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- On can use premade Actions
- Actions in `actions/` are maintained by GitHub
- [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) checks
  out the repository
- [`actions/setup-python`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python)
  configures a Python version
  - Similar actions exist for other environments, e.g., Node/Javascript etc.

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```yaml

job:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: '3.14'

      - run: python mycode.py
```

# Exercise 4: Matrix builds

# Security: Permissions

- Workflow contains `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`)
  - Can be used to use GitHub API from within workflow
- Explicitly set permissions, default permissions often too broad

```yaml
run-name: First workflow # Optional
permissions: {}

[...]
run-code:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
    contents: read
```

use](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use)

---

# Security: Third-party actions

- Pin the action to a commit hash, e.g., commit hash of a release

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5
  - uses: hadolint/hadolint-action@2332a7b74a6de0dda2e2221d575162eba76ba5e5 # v3.1.0
    with:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

# Costs

- Let's inspect the costs panel in our GitHub account
  - Your accounts -> Settings -> Billing and licensing
- GitHub covers costs of public repositories
- Equinor covers costs of Equinor repositoris
  - **Not visible in your account**

# Docker containers

```yaml
jobs:
  # Label of the container job
  container-job:
    # Containers must run in Linux based operating systems
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Docker Hub image that `container-job` executes in
    container: python:3.14-slim
```

# Artifacts

```yaml
  - name: "Create new file"
    run: echo "Hello world!" >> new_file.txt

  - name: "Upload Artifact"
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
    with:
      name: my-artifact
      path: new_file.txt

# Further topics

- Slack integration
- GitHub Action market place:
  [https://github.com/marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) and choose
  `Actions` -> `All Actions` on the left.

  - Be careful what Actions to choose. They may have access to your repository,
    secrets etc.
- [Reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows)
- Publication of software packages, e.g., Python wheels to PyPI
- Using self-hosted runners
